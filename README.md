## Why?

It all started when I saw `@Ruby`'s message in Hackclub Slack:

Why not take the challenge?

I started by integrating WakaTime with DaVinci Resolve, and you can check out the code [here!](https://github.com/LucasHT22/davinci-resolve-wakatime/)

Later on, `@guac md` reached out asking for tips on building a WakaTime plugin for Krita. While brainstorming a solution, I realized the DaVinci approach, relying on temp files, wouldnâ€™t work here. We needed something more robust, universal, and trackable.

The answer is: Process tracking. Every app runs as a system process, so why not use that as a reliable source of activity?

From that idea, General WakaTime was born, a cross-platform tracker that now supports 27 different applications and counting.
