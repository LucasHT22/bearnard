# General Wakatime (Currently only Windows!)
A robust, reliable and universal system to use Wakatime in almost any App.

Supporting 27 different applications and counting.

## Requirements

```pip install psutil pygetwindow pyautogui```

## How to use?
Step-by-step tutorial

### 1. Setting your API key
Replace `YOUR_WAKATIME_API_KEY` with your API key.
```WAKATIME_API_KEY = 'YOUR_WAKATIME_API_KEY'```

> [!WARNING]
> **If you're using any WakaTime version that isn't HackaTime (Hackclub) change url param in urllib.request.Request**

### 2. Setting your apps
Insert code block from `/apps` in `APPS`, you can add as many apps you want:)

#### Finding process name
Do not trust Task Manager, use `tasklist` on `cmd`.

## Why?

It all started when I saw `@Ruby`'s message in Hackclub Slack:

Why not take the challenge?

I started by integrating WakaTime with DaVinci Resolve, and you can check out the code [here!](https://github.com/LucasHT22/davinci-resolve-wakatime/)

Later on, `@guac md` reached out asking for tips on building a WakaTime plugin for Krita. While brainstorming a solution, I realized the DaVinci approach, relying on temp files, wouldnâ€™t work here. We needed something more robust, universal, and trackable.

The answer is: Process tracking. Every app runs as a system process, so why not use that as a reliable source of activity?

From that idea, General WakaTime was born, a cross-platform tracker that now supports 27 different applications and counting.
